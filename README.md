## ESG-Portfolio

By matching ESG scores (0-100) to selected stocks in the S&P 500 (from Sustainalytics),
assign different weights to each stock in the portfolio based on their ESG score.
Calculate the daily returns of the resulting portfolio from 2013 to 2018.
A higher lamdba means a higher preference towards ESG stocks. Our findings confirm the intuition that non-ESG portfolios deliver higher returns due to the reason that ESG stocks have higher demand and are overbought.
